## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create new TODO items
- Read existing TODO items
- Update TODO items
- Delete TODO items
- View a list of TODO items with their status (completed/incomplete)
- Experience a responsive design for both PC and mobile devices

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/CRUD_operations_MERN_stack_TODO_app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CRUD_operations_MERN_stack_TODO_app
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies for both the server and client:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## How to build

1. Build the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```
   
A `build` folder should be created inside the client directory.

## How to preview the build

1. Preview the build:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run serve
   ```

## My process

### Built with

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React
- Node.js
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Working on this project allowed me to solidify my understanding of full-stack development using the MERN stack. I gained valuable experience in managing state with React and implementing CRUD operations with Express and MongoDB.

### Continued development

I aim to further enhance the application by adding user authentication, implementing advanced filtering options, and optimizing the performance of the app.

### Useful resources
